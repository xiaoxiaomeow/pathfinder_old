    "prerequisites": "Int 19, Ironclad Logic, Diplomacy 5 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks",
    "benefit": "When you use Diplomacy to change the attitude of a character, you can first attempt a Sense Motive check against that NPC to get a hunch to determine whether the character is under the influence of an enchantment, to use Sense Assumptions, or to determine biases for a verbal duel. If you succeed at the Sense Motive check, you gain a +2 bonus on the Diplomacy check, and if you learned any biases for a verbal duel, you learn one additional bias of your choice. You do not worsen an NPC’s attitude if you fail a Diplomacy check by 5 or more.",
