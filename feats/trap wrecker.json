    "description": "You can smash traps instead of disarming them.",
    "prerequisites": "Power Attack, Disable Device 1 rank, orc",
    "benefit": "You can attempt to disarm a trap by striking it with a melee weapon instead of making a Disable Device check. As a full-round action, make a melee attack against an Armor Class equal to the trap’s Disable Device DC. If you miss, the trap activates. If you hit, roll damage. If this damage is at least half the trap’s Disable Device DC, you disable the trap. If this damage is less than half the trap’s Disable Device DC, the trap activates. You can only attempt this on nonmagical traps. You must be able to reach some part of the trap with your attack in order to use this feat. At the GM’s discretion, some traps may not be susceptible to this feat.",
