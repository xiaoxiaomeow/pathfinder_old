    "description": "You are accustomed to diving deeper than most would dare swim and can do so with less risk of drowning than even other experienced swimmers.",
    "prerequisites": "Endurance",
    "benefit": "You gain a +4 bonus on Acrobatics checks to reduce falling damage when diving into water and on Perception checks in dim light or darkness underwater. When attempting a Swim check to swim downward (at least 45 degrees down from the horizontal), on a successful check you can swim half your speed as a move action, or your speed as a full-round action. If you have a swim speed, it increases by 10 feet when you spend a move action to swim only downward.",
