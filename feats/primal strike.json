    "description": "You have learned to draw primal magic through your body to befuddle your enemies.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 17, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8",
    "benefit": "Before making an attack roll, you can declare a primal strike. If you do and the attack hits, it deals damage normally and your target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier). A target who fails this saving throw is confused for 1 round. If you are in an area of primal magic, the confused condition lasts for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt a primal strike attack once per day for every 4 character levels you have (see Special below if you have monk levels), but no more than once per round. A primal strike is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.",
    "special": "If you have levels in the monk class, you can make a primal attack a number of times per day equal to your monk level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels you have in classes other than monk, though still no more than once per round.",
    "prerequisiteKeys": ["improved unarmed strike"]
