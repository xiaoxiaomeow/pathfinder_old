    "description": "You can use your tail to defend against trip attacks and to hang from nearby protrusions.",
    "prerequisites": "Acrobatics 1 rank, vanara",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against all trip attacks. If your square has a branch or other sturdy large object that you could hang from, as a swift action you may make a DC 15 Acrobatics check to jump upward and use your tail to hang from that object. While hanging, you can’t be tripped, you ignore the effects of difficult terrain in your square, and you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attacks. If you leave that square (including if you are moved against your will), you lose your grip on the object and are no longer hanging. While hanging, you cannot use your tail for anything else.",

    "staminaText": "When you jump upward to use your tail to hang from an object, you can spend up to 5 stamina points. You gain a bonus on the Acrobatics check equal to the number of stamina points you spent."
