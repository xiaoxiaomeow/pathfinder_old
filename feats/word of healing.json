    "description": "Using the same divine energy as your lay on hands ability, you can heal others at a distance.",
    "prerequisites": "Lay on hands class feature",
    "benefit": "You may use your lay on hands to heal another creature at a range of 30 feet as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must be able to speak and have a free hand to use this ability. The target heals half the amount they would have healed if you had touched them, but gains the benefits of your mercies as normal."
