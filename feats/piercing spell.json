    "description": "Your studies have helped you develop methods to overcome spell resistance.",
    "benefit": "When you cast a piercing spell against a target with spell resistance, it treats the spell resistance of the target as 5 lower than its actual SR. A piercing spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level."
